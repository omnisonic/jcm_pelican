Title: About 
Status: draft

I perform, compose, arrange, and teach guitar music.
<!-- 
I really love music.

I started guitar lessons when I was 11 years old but only for a couple of years.  I am mostly self-taught.

In college I didn't think music was the best career option, so I studied in the Social Sciences--hoping  to make a difference in the world.  

During my last year of college, on a field study project, I was exposed to street performing and decided to try it myself.

I first busked in the subways of Boston, Massachusetts.  The response I got surprised me.  Not only was I making money, but some people left me little notes.  They  said things like how they were having a bad day.  And, that  listening to me play guitar, as they waited for the subway train, made them feel better.   Playing guitar for people also made me happy.  So I decided to go back to music and give it my all. -->
