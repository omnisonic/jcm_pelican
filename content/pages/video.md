I first started working on 'Pier Loop' when I was using a loop pedal to loop phrases of the guitar and layer them over each other. I had totally forgotten about this song for some years until I found a recording on YouTube someone had made of my playing it at Pier 39 in San Francisco. Here in its final version. Really glad my friends and collaborators, Josh and Rob, were willing to contribute to the recording. Their performances are always such an amazing addition to my music.

There was a photographer/videographer I met while playing at Pier 39 in San Francisco who I became friends with. He did a great job putting this video together. This song name was made up with the help of people on youtube.com. Thanks youtube friends!

<div class="video-description">
"To Live" is the first classical guitar piece I wrote. Also one of the only published songs I originally wrote on paper--since then I have moved to writing music on the computer. The song title is partially inspired by a Chinese film of the same name.

This song gets its name from the fact that I have strange ways of naming songs. I was preparing to record this song on an album that included a number of other songs I had written. While I was trying to think of a name for the song, it occurred to me that this song had changed the 'most' since I first starting playing it. So I thought I would just call it 'The Most Evolved' until I thought of something better. I never did think of a better name but this song itself is about something else entirely.

### Spanish Romance {.centered}

'Spanish Romance' is a bit of a mystery. Its composer is unknown. Many people have told me it comes from their country. It is an enchanting and beautiful melody.

### Revolution {.centered}

</div>

<div class="video-description">
'Revolution' is inspired in part by Richard Stover and his book 'The Latin American Guitar Guide' where I learned one of the finger patterns used in the song. It's also inspired by the idea of people overturning authoritarian rule and replacing it with democracy.

This was a fantastic location for a street performance. Thanks San Diego, California for the opportunity to play on the gorgeous beach! Thanks to the videographer for helping to preserve the memory.
